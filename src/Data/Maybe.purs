-- | The `Maybe` type is used to represent optional values and can be seen as
-- | something like a type-safe `null`, where `Nothing` is `null` and `Just x`
-- | is the non-null value `x`.
data Maybe a = Nothing | Just a

-- | Takes a default value, a function, and a `Maybe` value. If the `Maybe`
-- | value is `Nothing` the default value is returned, otherwise the function
-- | is applied to the value inside the `Just` and the result is returned.
-- |
-- | ``` purescript
-- | maybe x f Nothing == x
-- | maybe x f (Just y) == f y
-- | ```
maybe :: forall a b. b -> (a -> b) -> Maybe a -> b
maybe b _ Nothing = b
maybe _ f (Just a) = f a

-- | Takes a default value, and a `Maybe` value. If the `Maybe` value is
-- | `Nothing` the default value is returned, otherwise the value inside the
-- | `Just` is returned.
-- |
-- | ``` purescript
-- | fromMaybe x Nothing == x
-- | fromMaybe x (Just y) == y
-- | ```
fromMaybe :: forall a. a -> Maybe a -> a
fromMaybe a = maybe a (id :: forall a. a -> a)

-- | Returns `true` when the `Maybe` value was constructed with `Just`.
isJust :: forall a. Maybe a -> Boolean
isJust = maybe false (const true)

-- | Returns `true` when the `Maybe` value is `Nothing`.
isNothing :: forall a. Maybe a -> Boolean
isNothing = maybe true (const false)

-- | The `Functor` instance allows functions to transform the contents of a
-- | `Just` with the `<$>` operator:
-- |
-- | ``` purescript
-- | f <$> Just x == Just (f x)
-- | ```
-- |
-- | `Nothing` values are left untouched:
-- |
-- | ``` purescript
-- | f <$> Nothing == Nothing
-- | ```
instance functorMaybe :: Functor Maybe where
  map fn (Just x) = Just (fn x)
  map _  _        = Nothing

-- | The `Apply` instance allows functions contained within a `Just` to
-- | transform a value contained within a `Just` using the `apply` operator:
-- |
-- | ``` purescript
-- | Just f <*> Just x == Just (f x)
-- | ```
-- |
-- | `Nothing` values are left untouched:
-- |
-- | ``` purescript
-- | Just f <*> Nothing == Nothing
-- | Nothing <*> Just x == Nothing
-- | ```
-- |
-- | Combining `Functor`'s `<$>` with `Apply`'s `<*>` can be used transform a
-- | pure function to take `Maybe`-typed arguments so `f :: a -> b -> c`
-- | becomes `f :: Maybe a -> Maybe b -> Maybe c`:
-- |
-- | ``` purescript
-- | f <$> Just x <*> Just y == Just (f x y)
-- | ```
-- |
-- | The `Nothing`-preserving behaviour of both operators means the result of
-- | an expression like the above but where any one of the values is `Nothing`
-- | means the whole result becomes `Nothing` also:
-- |
-- | ``` purescript
-- | f <$> Nothing <*> Just y == Nothing
-- | f <$> Just x <*> Nothing == Nothing
-- | f <$> Nothing <*> Nothing == Nothing
-- | ```
instance applyMaybe :: Apply Maybe where
  apply (Just fn) x = fn <$> x
  apply Nothing   _ = Nothing

-- | The `Applicative` instance enables lifting of values into `Maybe` with the
-- | `pure` or `return` function (`return` is an alias for `pure`):
-- |
-- | ``` purescript
-- | pure x :: Maybe _ == Just x
-- | return x :: Maybe _ == Just x
-- | ```
-- |
-- | Combining `Functor`'s `<$>` with `Apply`'s `<*>` and `Applicative`'s
-- | `pure` can be used to pass a mixture of `Maybe` and non-`Maybe` typed
-- | values to a function that does not usually expect them, by using `pure`
-- | for any value that is not already `Maybe` typed:
-- |
-- | ``` purescript
-- | f <$> Just x <*> pure y == Just (f x y)
-- | ```
-- |
-- | Even though `pure = Just` it is recommended to use `pure` in situations
-- | like this as it allows the choice of `Applicative` to be changed later
-- | without having to go through and replace `Just` with a new constructor.
instance applicativeMaybe :: Applicative Maybe where
  pure = Just

-- | The `Alt` instance allows for a choice to be made between two `Maybe`
-- | values with the `<|>` operator, where the first `Just` encountered
-- | is taken.
-- |
-- | ``` purescript
-- | Just x <|> Just y == Just x
-- | Nothing <|> Just y == Just y
-- | Nothing <|> Nothing == Nothing
-- | ```
instance altMaybe :: Alt Maybe where
  alt Nothing r = r
  alt l       _ = l

-- | The `Plus` instance provides a default `Maybe` value:
-- |
-- | ``` purescript
-- | empty :: Maybe _ == Nothing
-- | ```
instance plusMaybe :: Plus Maybe where
  empty = Nothing

-- | The `Alternative` instance guarantees that there are both `Applicative` and
-- | `Plus` instances for `Maybe`.
instance alternativeMaybe :: Alternative Maybe

-- | The `Bind` instance allows sequencing of `Maybe` values and functions that
-- | return a `Maybe` by using the `>>=` operator:
-- |
-- | ``` purescript
-- | Just x >>= f = f x
-- | Nothing >>= f = Nothing
-- | ```
instance bindMaybe :: Bind Maybe where
  bind (Just x) k = k x
  bind Nothing  _ = Nothing

-- | The `Monad` instance guarantees that there are both `Applicative` and
-- | `Bind` instances for `Maybe`. This also enables the `do` syntactic sugar:
-- |
-- | ``` purescript
-- | do
-- |   x' <- x
-- |   y' <- y
-- |   pure (f x' y')
-- | ```
-- |
-- | Which is equivalent to:
-- |
-- | ``` purescript
-- | x >>= (\x' -> y >>= (\y' -> pure (f x' y')))
-- | ```
instance monadMaybe :: Monad Maybe

-- | The `MonadPlus` instance guarantees that there are both `Monad` and
-- | `Alternative` instances for `Maybe`.
instance monadPlusMaybe :: MonadPlus Maybe

-- | The `Extend` instance allows sequencing of `Maybe` values and functions
-- | that accept a `Maybe a` and return a non-`Maybe` result using the
-- | `<<=` operator.
-- |
-- | ``` purescript
-- | f <<= Nothing = Nothing
-- | f <<= Just x = Just (f x)
-- | ```
instance extendMaybe :: Extend Maybe where
  extend _ Nothing  = Nothing
  extend f x        = Just (f x)

instance invariantMaybe :: Invariant Maybe where
  imap = imapF

-- | The `Semigroup` instance enables use of the operator `<>` on `Maybe` values
-- | whenever there is a `Semigroup` instance for the type the `Maybe` contains.
-- | The exact behaviour of `<>` depends on the "inner" `Semigroup` instance,
-- | but generally captures the notion of appending or combining things.
-- |
-- | ``` purescript
-- | Just x <> Just y = Just (x <> y)
-- | Just x <> Nothing = Just x
-- | Nothing <> Just y = Just y
-- | Nothing <> Nothing = Nothing
-- | ```

-- | The `Ord` instance allows `Maybe` values to be compared with
